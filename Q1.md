### Q.1 Explain Middlewares in NodeJS ?
Ans:In Node.js, middlewares are a key concept used to handle requests and responses in the web application framework. They provide a way to execute custom logic in the request-response cycle by intercepting HTTP requests and modifying or augmenting them before they reach the final handler.

A middleware function in Node.js is a function that has access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the application's request-response cycle. It can perform various tasks such as modifying the request or response objects, executing additional code, terminating the request-response cycle, or passing control to the next middleware function.

Here's how the middleware process typically works in Node.js:

1-The server receives an incoming HTTP request.

2-The request passes through a series of middleware functions, in the order they were defined.

3-Each middleware function can perform operations on the request or response objects, modify data, or perform additional tasks.

4-If a middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it calls the next function to pass control to the next middleware function.

5-The final middleware function ends the request-response cycle by sending a response back to the client.

Middleware functions can be used for a variety of purposes, such as logging, error handling, authentication, authorization, data parsing, and more. They provide a modular way to add functionality to your Node.js application without cluttering the main request handler function.

To use middleware in a Node.js application, you typically use the app.use() method provided by popular web frameworks like Express.js. For example:

```JavaScript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Middleware function
const loggerMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Request received:', req.method, req.url);
  next(); // Pass control to the next middleware function
};

// Using the middleware
app.use(loggerMiddleware);

// Route handler
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, world!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server started on port 3000');
});
```

In the above example, the loggerMiddleware function is a simple middleware that logs the incoming requests. By using app.use(loggerMiddleware), the middleware is registered and will be executed for every incoming request before reaching the route handler.

This is just a basic example, and middleware functions can be much more complex, depending on the requirements of your application. They provide a flexible and powerful way to add functionality to your Node.js web applications.
