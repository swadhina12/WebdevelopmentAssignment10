### Q.2 Why use Express Over NodeJS ?
Ans:Express is a web application framework built on top of Node.js. It provides a higher-level abstraction and a set of powerful features that make it easier to develop web applications compared to using Node.js alone. Here are some reasons why you might choose to use Express over raw Node.js:

1-Simplicity and Minimalism: Express provides a minimal and unopinionated framework that doesn't impose many restrictions on how you structure your application. It allows you to start building web applications quickly without unnecessary boilerplate code.

2-Routing: Express offers a robust routing system that allows you to define routes for different HTTP methods and URLs. It provides an intuitive and flexible way to handle various endpoints and request types, making it easy to organize your application's routes.

3-Middleware: Express has excellent middleware support, which allows you to add functionality to your application's request-response cycle easily. Middleware functions can handle tasks such as logging, authentication, data parsing, error handling, and more. The vast ecosystem of existing middleware modules makes it convenient to integrate common functionalities into your application.

4-Template Engines: Express has built-in support for template engines like EJS, Pug, and Handlebars. Template engines enable you to dynamically generate HTML and render views, making it easier to create dynamic web pages and handle server-side rendering.

5-HTTP Utility Methods: Express provides a set of convenient utility methods for handling common HTTP operations. It simplifies tasks such as setting response headers, sending responses, handling redirects, and managing cookies.

6-Middleware Ecosystem: Express has a rich ecosystem of third-party middleware modules available, allowing you to extend its functionality easily. There are middleware packages for various purposes, such as authentication (Passport.js), logging (Morgan), request validation (Joi), and many more. This extensive ecosystem saves development time by providing pre-built solutions for common web development tasks.

7-Flexibility and Extensibility: Express is highly flexible and extensible, allowing you to integrate additional libraries and modules as needed. You can leverage the power of the Node.js ecosystem by using any npm package alongside Express to enhance your application's capabilities.

8-Community and Documentation: Express has a large and active community of developers, which means you can find plenty of resources, tutorials, and support when working with Express. The framework has comprehensive documentation that guides you through its features and usage, making it easier to learn and use effectively.

While Node.js itself provides a low-level API for building network applications, Express abstracts away many complexities and provides a higher-level framework that simplifies web development. It is a popular choice for building web applications in Node.js due to its simplicity, flexibility, and extensive ecosystem.
