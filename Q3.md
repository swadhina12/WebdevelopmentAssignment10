### Q.3 What are REST API ?
Ans:REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. It is an architectural style for designing networked applications. REST is an approach that allows systems to communicate over the internet using the HTTP protocol.

In a RESTful architecture, resources (such as data objects or services) are identified by URLs (Uniform Resource Locators), and interactions with these resources are performed through standard HTTP methods, including GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. These methods correspond to the operations of retrieving, creating, updating, partially updating, and deleting resources, respectively.

REST APIs are stateless, meaning that each request from a client to a server must contain all the necessary information for the server to understand and process the request. The server, in turn, sends back a response with the requested data or a status code indicating the outcome of the request.

Key principles of REST API design include:

1-Resource-based: Resources are identified by URLs and are the focal point of RESTful interactions.

2-Stateless: Each request contains all the necessary information for the server to process it, and the server doesn't retain any state about the client.

3-Uniform interface: REST APIs use a consistent set of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) and status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found) for communication.

4-Client-Server architecture: The client and server are separate entities that communicate over the network, allowing for independent evolution and scalability.

5-Layered system: The architecture can be composed of multiple layers, where each layer provides specific functionality, enhancing scalability and flexibility.

REST APIs are widely used in web development to build scalable and interoperable systems. They allow different applications and services to communicate and exchange data in a standardized and platform-independent manner.
