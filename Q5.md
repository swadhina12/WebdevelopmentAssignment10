### Q.5  What is Mongoose and how does it relate to MongoDB?
Ans:Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for Node.js that provides a higher-level abstraction layer over MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database. It simplifies the interaction with MongoDB by providing a more intuitive and structured way to define schemas, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and perform data validation.

Here's how Mongoose relates to MongoDB:

1-Schema Definition: Mongoose allows you to define schemas for your MongoDB collections. A schema defines the structure, data types, and validation rules for documents in a collection. By defining a schema, you can enforce consistency and data integrity within your application.

2-Model Creation: Using Mongoose, you can create models based on the defined schemas. A model is a JavaScript representation of a MongoDB collection. It provides an interface to interact with the database, allowing you to perform CRUD operations and define custom business logic.

3-Data Validation: Mongoose supports built-in and custom data validation mechanisms. You can specify validation rules in the schema definition, and Mongoose ensures that the data being saved or updated adheres to those rules. This helps maintain data quality and prevents invalid data from being persisted.

4-Middleware and Hooks: Mongoose provides middleware functions and hooks that allow you to define pre and post-processing logic for various operations such as saving, updating, and removing documents. This gives you the ability to perform additional actions or modify data before or after it is saved or retrieved from the database.

5-Query Building: Mongoose simplifies the creation of database queries by providing a chainable API for building queries. It supports a wide range of query operators and methods to perform complex operations such as filtering, sorting, pagination, and aggregation.

Overall, Mongoose enhances the functionality of MongoDB by providing a structured and intuitive way to interact with the database. It adds features like data validation, middleware, and query building capabilities, making it easier to work with MongoDB in a Node.js environment.
